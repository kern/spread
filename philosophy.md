#Our philosophy

Redspread's mission is to empower people to own their own deployment process and infrastructure. We're building the tools and workflows to fulfill that mission.

We value collaboration, transparency, and fairness in everything we do.

We also think the following are true:

* Container versioning (i.e. versioning both images and configuration) will become increasingly important over the next year as more people use containers in production, just as versioning services has become common practice. 
* Software development is a multi-player game played with single player tools. Better collaborative tooling needs to be built for software organizations.
* Introducing proprietary software into your infrastructure introduces external market risk into your product, and this risk should be very carefully considered whenever evaluating options.
